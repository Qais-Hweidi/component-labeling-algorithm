# component-labeling-algorithm
component labeling algorithm using python

Use instructions:
- "image_path" input image path, "min_val" & "max_val" min and max intinsity levels, "size_threshold" for size filter. You can change these values in the code as you wish.
- The output will always be 5 images, first one is the original.
- You should input a binary image for task 1, 2 and 4, the correct output is "4-Connectivity" & "8-Connectivity" & "After Size Filter" pictures, ignore all other output pictures.
- You should input a grayscale image for task 3, the correct output is "4-Connectivity with Intensity Range" picture, ignore all other output pictures.
